### Taiga is a corpus, where text sources and their meta-information are collected according to popular ML tasks.
 Each text in corpus is represented in plain text and with morphological and syntactic annotation (UDPipe, homonymy resolved automatically) + has metainformation - date, theme, authorship, text difficulcy...etc (depending on source)  
 
By now, about 500 millions of words are 50% literary texts (33 literary magazines), 25% of news (4 popular sites) and 25% of other (popular science, culture mags, social networks, amateur poems and prose), with documentation [available](https://tatianashavrina.github.io/taiga_site/segments).

## We have gathered the resources with respect to popular NLP-problems:

- thematic modelling - news with theme tags, all the sites which provide rubrication (news, poems, prose)
- readability of texts - a popular science magazine NPlus1 has a readability metric for each text, provided by editor.
- NER and fact extraction - news with references to mentioned person’s page or wiki-information, news with personalia tags
- key-words extraction - news with key-word tags, hashtags on social media
- authorship attribution - all the texts with author information - magazines, news, and more important - social media - with gender, age, city, time and education mark-up.
- chat-bot training - open-source film subtitles
- text generation - any resource depending on genre
- rare words studying, frequency dictionaries - literary magazines, social media
- morphological and syntactic parsers - any resource with respect to the genre

 
Taiga corpus is an ambitious project to become the largest fully available webcorpus constructed from open text sources. 
Taiga corpus is:
 - open source, CC BY-SA 3.0 
 - big - about 500 million words by now 
 - sorted by datasets applicable to different machine laearning tasks
 - made by linguists, experienced in text crawling, parsing and filtering
 - rich with metainformation
 - POS-tagged and syntactically tagged in Universal Dependencies

With these principles, we believe that a corpus product that meets modern requirements of corpus linguistics can be created - it will not be a black box, it will be reflecting modern language and its features, not biased and capable of encouraging more cooperation between developers and linguists.
